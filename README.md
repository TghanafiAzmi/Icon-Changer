🎨 Icon Changer - Bulk Icon Color Changer

✨ What is this wizardry?

So, you've got a bunch of icons that all look the same, and you want to give them a fresh coat of paint? 🎨 Well, congratulations! 🎉 You've just stumbled upon the most handsome (self-proclaimed) software for bulk icon color changing.

This tool allows you to take a bunch of PNG images and swap out their colors like you're some kind of digital Picasso. 🖌️ No more dull, lifeless icons—time to give them a glow-up! 💫

🚀 How to Use

📥 Download & Install Python - If you don’t have Python installed, get it from the Microsoft Store.

Open Microsoft Store 🏬

Search for Python 🔎

Click Install 🖱️

Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Verify installation by opening CMD and running:

python --version

📦 Install Dependencies - Open CMD and install the following packages manually:

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install customtkinter

If pip is not recognized, try using:

python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install customtkinter

🚀 Launch the software - No need to perform any dark rituals, just double-click icon_changer.py and let the magic begin. ✨

Alternatively, open CMD in the software folder and run:

python icon_changer.py

🖼️ Select your images - Click the "Browse" button and pick your PNG files. Yes, you can choose multiple—this isn't amateur hour. 😎

📂 Choose an output folder - Where do you want the newly stylish icons to go? Select a folder, preferably one where you can find them later. 🗂️

🎨 Enter a new color - Provide a HEX color (e.g., FF0000 for red 🔴, 00FF00 for green 🟢, etc.). If you enter something crazy like GGGGGG, don't be surprised if nothing works. 🤦‍♂️

⚡ Click "Process Images" - Sit back, relax, and watch as the magic happens. 🪄

✅ Done! - A message will pop up letting you know that everything was successful. If something went wrong... well, blame the universe (or double-check your inputs). 🌎
